# Research & Quality Improvement Portfolio

Evidence of research leadership, clinical quality improvement expertise, and health systems evaluation across UK acute care and international settings.

---

## Overview

**8 projects spanning research, clinical practice, and systems evaluation:**

- **Published Research:** MD thesis research (prize-awarded)
- **UK Clinical Practice:** 6 QI projects across neurosurgery and plastic surgery; team-led and independent initiatives; systematic audit with national validation (literature synthesis, baseline audit, intervention, re-audit)
- **International Health Systems Evaluation:** Digital Centre Management System implementation & change management (ICRC, 2020–2022); training impact assessment across Central America   
- **Quality Improvement Training:** Scottish Improvement Foundation Skills (SIFS) programme completion; departmental audit support
- **Systematic Scoping Review:** IMG Mental Wellbeing; primary investigator, University of Glasgow

## Context

This portfolio documents research and clinical work. Some part has completed as part of **[PhD Preparation: Computational Cognitive Science](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep)** — Phase 1 onwards.

While the main PhD prep repository tracks learning and skill development, this portfolio showcases the applied research and clinical leadership outcomes from that learning journey.
Notably, the international health systems evaluation work—particularly the change management and implementation science dimensions—directly shaped my research interest in neurocognitive decision-making and how humans adapt to change in complex systems.

Each project in this portfolio reflects a commitment to understanding human behaviour within complex systems—whether clinical, organisational, or cognitive—and to adopting improvements and innovations that have meaningful impact in the real world.
