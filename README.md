## Context

This portfolio documents research and clinical work. Some part has completed as part of **[PhD Preparation: Computational Cognitive Science](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep)** — Phase 1 onwards.

While the main PhD prep repository tracks learning and skill development, this portfolio showcases the applied research and clinical leadership outcomes from that learning journey.
