## Primary research question(s)
What is known or has been published about IMGs' mental well-being? 

## Secondary research question(s)
1.	Are IMGs at higher risk of poor mental well-being, especially compared to DMG?
2.	What are the consequences of poor mental well-being in IMGs? 
3.	What factors positively or negatively affect IMGs’ mental well-being?
4.	What interventions have been instigated to foster good mental well-being of IMGs or to mitigate the negative factors that might affect it? 

## Expectations / hypotheses
From previous work, we expect to demonstrate a paucity of the literature regarding IMGs' well-being. 

## Methodology
Systematic scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines
Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework

Review stages
We will follow Arksey and O'Maley's six-stage process: 
1. Identifying the research questions
2. Identifying relevant studies
3. Study selection
4. Charting the data
5. Collating, summarising, and reporting the results
6. Consultation exercise


## Search Strategy

### Databases Searched
- MEDLINE
- Embase
- CINAHL
- PsychINFO
- Web of Science
- Cochrane
- Google Scholar

### Interfaces
Ovid

### Grey literature
The grey literature will be identified from the above databases, especially Web of Science and Google Scholar for conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. Furthermore, we will conduct a Google search to identify reports and monographs published by international, governmental and non-governmental organisations. We will limit the latter search to a maximum of 200 'hits'.
