## Programme Overview

SIFS is a structured quality improvement training programme designed to develop skills in improvement science methodology. The programme teaches participants to:
- Explain quality improvement concepts and importance
- Apply improvement science tools (PDSA, measurement, systems thinking)
- Design and test small-scale improvement projects
- Report and communicate findings

## My project

During the SIFS programme, I supported a **large-scale departmental QI initiative** by participating in team meetings and conducting data gathering. I identified an opportunity to improve the induction process for new QI team members and proposed designing an **"Introductory Tool for New Members"** to standardize and streamline both team onboarding and data collection practices. I completed a **PDSA cycle** to test and refine this tool, demonstrating practical application of improvement science principles learned during the programme.
