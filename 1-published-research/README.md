## Published Research

This paper was started originally as the thesis for our MD -Medical Degree-. We investigated the relationship between sugary drink consumption and overweight prevalence in schoolchildren through a survey-based study. The innovative methodological approach involved partnering with the **Ceibal Programme**, Uruguay's national initiative to provide every child with a laptop computer. By training teachers to administer the survey, the research design had the potential to reach schools across the entire country, including under-resourced and rural regions—addressing a significant equity gap in health research.
Although the initial approach proved too early for sustained system integration and was not maintained as a routine data-gathering mechanism, the quality of the research concept and execution led to its continuation. Pediatrics trainees and faculty expanded the work, which subsequently [received recognition through a prize for independent research excellence](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-QI-portfolio/blob/main/1-published-research/FEMI%20prize%20for%20independent%20research.pdf). The research was published in [Revista de la Sociedad Uruguaya de Pediatría](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-QI-portfolio/blob/main/1-published-research/Article-Soft%20drink%20consumption%20in%204th%20graders%20and%20its%20relationship%20with%20overweight%20and%20obesity) and can be found online at [SciELO Uruguay](http://www.scielo.edu.uy/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1688-12492018000400026#:~:text=Los%20resultados%20mostraron%20una%20asociaci%C3%B3n,el%20ni%C3%B1o%20sea%20obeso26.).

**Title:** "Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity in School Children and its Relation with Beverage Consumption"

**Authors:** Karina Machado, Patricia Teylechea, Amanda Bermúdez, Jonathan Lara, Melania Geymonat, Fabrizzio Girardi, Mariana García, Sebastián Vecchio, Catalina Pírez

**Published:** Revista de la Sociedad Uruguaya de Pediatría, 2018

**DOI/Link:** [Consumo de bebidas en niños de cuarto año escolar y su relación con sobrepeso-obesidad](https://doi.org/10.31134/ap.89.s1.3 )

**Study Design:** Descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study

**Participants:** 464 school children (4th graders) from Montevideo, Libertad, and San José de Mayo, Uruguay

**Key Findings:**
- Prevalence: 28.2% overweight, 14.2% obese (n=197)
- Water consumption: 75.9% very frequent
- Dairy products: 75.6% very frequent
- Soft drinks: 24.6% very frequent consumption
- No significant association found between soft drink consumption and overweight/obesity

**Conclusions:** High prevalence of overweight/obesity in the studied population. While soft drink consumption didn't show direct association, emphasizes importance of promoting healthy eating habits and preventing obesity.
