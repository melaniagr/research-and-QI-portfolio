**4. Literature review of iNPWD for Spinal Fusions and review of local practice at ARI** 

**Supervisor:** Mr. Mohit Arora, Consultant Neurosurgeon

**Background:** NICE guidance exists for iNPWD (incisional negative pressure wound dressings) in colorectal, cardiothoracic, vascular, and orthopedic surgery—but not spinal surgery. Use based on surgeon preference rather than evidence.

**Methods:**
- Literature review: Published evidence on iNPWD in spinal fusion
- Retrospective audit: 182 consecutive spinal fusion cases (July 2021–July 2023)
  - 15 cases with iNPWD (13 prophylactic)
  - 13 matched controls without iNPWD

**Key Findings:**
- iNPWD group: 0% surgical site infection (SSI)
- Control group: 15.4% SSI (2/13 patients)

**Impact:** **Presented at Scottish Spine Surgeons 14th Annual Meeting** (national conference), reaching senior surgeons across Scotland. Contributed to emerging evidence base for spinal surgery guidance.
