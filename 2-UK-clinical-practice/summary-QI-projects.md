## Study Design

**Evaluation Framework:** Kirkpatrick Level 3 (Behavioral Change Assessment)  
**Method:** Post-course participant survey  
**Survey Characteristics:**
- 19 closed and open-ended questions
- Administered via MS Forms
- 7-day response window
- Completion time: ~5-7 minutes

**Sample:**
- Target: 75 course participants (5 BEC courses across 3 countries)
- Respondents: 27 participants
- Response rate: 39%
- Survey timing: 2-6 months post-course

---

## Key Findings

### Behavioral Change: Strong Evidence
**Question 10 - Clinical Skill Improvement:**
Participants reported significant improvement across all 7 focus areas:
- ABCDE Method
- Patient transfer
- Trauma primary survey
- Trauma secondary survey
- Shortness of breath
- Shock management
- Altered consciousness

**Result:** ≥75% of respondents scored 4-5 on 5-point scale ("very significant change") for each domain

### Learning Effectiveness: Practical Elements Win
**Question 9 - Training Modality Benefit:**
Ranked by effectiveness:
1. **Simulations** (highest rating)
2. **Skills stations**
3. **Knowledge evaluation/testing**
4. **Case discussion**
5. **Workbook**
6. **Presentations/videos** (lowest rating)

**Insight:** Hands-on, applied learning methods significantly outperformed theoretical instruction

### Implementation Barriers: Resource Constraints Dominant
**Question 15 - Barriers to Application:**
Primary barrier identified: **"Lack of supplies" / "Lack of material"**
(Appeared 3x most frequently in word cloud analysis)

Other barriers cited:
- Limited clinical opportunities
- Work environment constraints
- Time limitations

### Knowledge Application: Real-World Examples
**Question 11 - Behavioral Change Evidence:**
Participants reported applying course knowledge in:
- Systematic ABCDE approach to patient assessment
- Airway stabilization techniques
- Shock management protocols
- Trauma case resolution
- Teaching colleagues using BEC framework

**Quote:** *"It has changed my mindset and my attitude toward extreme patients where following the ABCD chain of survival makes the difference between life and death"*

### Future Implementation: Trainer Cascade Model
**Question 13 - Planned Knowledge Application:**
Majority of respondents intended to:
- Train colleagues and staff (knowledge dissemination)
- Replicate BEC courses in their regions
- Share knowledge with community and detention settings
- Integrate systematic approach into facility protocols

### Course Improvement: Simulations Essential
**Question 18 - Suggestions for Enhancement:**
Repeated feedback: **"Simulations must stay as part of BEC"** and **"Keep and increase the number of simulations"**

Reasoning cited:
- Integrates multiple learned concepts
- Reduces stress response during real emergencies
- Enables team coordination practice
- Reinforces decision-making under pressure

## Methodological Strengths

✓ **Systematic Design:** Survey developed with Subject Matter Experts  
✓ **Structured Framework:** Aligned with established Kirkpatrick evaluation model  
✓ **Mixed Methods:** Combination of Likert scales (quantitative) + open-ended questions (qualitative)  
✓ **Multi-country Implementation:** Evaluation across 3 countries with diverse contexts  
✓ **Multiple Modalities:** Assessed face-to-face intensive, spaced face-to-face, and hybrid formats  

---

## Limitations Acknowledged

- **Response bias:** 39% response rate; characteristics of non-responders unknown
- **Self-report validity:** Behavioral change based on participant perception, not observed performance
- **Temporal gap:** 2-6 months between course delivery and survey may affect recall
- **Survey notification:** Participants not informed about survey pre/during course (potential response bias)
- **Observational gap:** No supervisor or on-site observation data to triangulate findings

---

## Implications for Program

**What Worked:**
- Practical, simulation-based learning drives behavioral change
- Multi-modal training (face-to-face intensive) most effective
- Participants motivated to cascade knowledge to colleagues
- Systematic approach resonates across provider levels

**What Needs Support:**
- Resource availability (supplies, equipment) critical enabler
- Supervisor engagement needed to sustain behavioral change
- Trainer development pathway required for knowledge multiplication
- Ongoing communication/support post-course important

**Recommendation:** Behavioral change alone insufficient without systems-level support (resources, protocols, supervisor enablement).

**Documentation** at [Scottish Spine Surgeons' 14th meeting - National Conference programme and abstracts](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/phase-1-introductory/research-and-QI/QI-projects-documentation/Scottish%20Spine%20Surgeons%2014th%20Annual%20Meeting%20-%20programme%20and%20abstracts.pdf) , [presentation](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/phase-1-introductory/research-and-QI/QI-projects-documentation/Incisional%20Negative%20Pressure%20Wound%20Dressings%20(iNPWD)%20for%20spinal%20fusions.pptx) and [consultant's endorsement](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/phase-1-introductory/research-and-QI/consultants-endorsements/Letter%20Mr%20Arora.pdf)

Abstract:

**Background:** While NICE-approved guidance exists for iNPWD use in colorectal, cardiothoracic, vascular, and orthopedic surgery, there is no clear guidance for spinal surgery. Use is based on surgeon preference rather than evidence-based indications.

**Methods:**
- **Literature Review:** Systematic review of published evidence on iNPWD in spinal fusion procedures
- **Retrospective Audit:** Analysis of 182 consecutive spinal fusion cases (July 2021 - July 2023) at ARI
  - Identified 15 cases where iNPWD was used (13 prophylactically)
  - Compared to 13 demographically matched controls without iNPWD
  - Data sources: inpatient notes, discharge letters, outpatient follow-up records

**Key Findings:**
- **iNPWD group (n=13):** 0% surgical site infection (SSI), normal wound healing in all cases
- **Control group (n=13):** 15.4% SSI rate (2/13 patients)
- **Implication:** Potential benefit of prophylactic iNPWD in reducing SSI in spinal fusion procedures

**Conclusions & Recommendations:**
- iNPWD shows promise for spinal fusion procedures but requires further investigation
- Need for prospective studies to establish clear indications and guidelines
- Potential for cost savings and improved patient outcomes with wider implementation

**Impact:** Project escalated to **national presentation at Scottish Spine Surgeons 14th Annual Meeting** (2024), reaching senior surgeons and peers across Scotland. Contributed to emerging evidence base for iNPWD use in spinal surgery.

**Deliverables:** Literature review, audit protocol, data analysis, presentation slides, departmental report
