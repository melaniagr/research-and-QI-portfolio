# 1. BEC Training Evaluation: ICRC Central America

[BEC training evaluation report - selected content](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-QI-portfolio/blob/main/3-international-health-systems/Basic%20Emergency%20Course%20training%20evaluation%20report-%20selected%20content.pdf)

**Project:** Evaluated behavioral impact of Basic Emergency Care training  
**Organization:** International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  
**Location:** Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico (2020–2021)  
**Your Role:** Conceived project, designed framework, led data gathering & analysis under supervision of SME
**Sample:** 75 health workers across 5 courses; 27 respondents (39% response rate)

## Evaluation Design

**Framework:** Kirkpatrick Level 3 (behavioral change assessment)  
**Method:** Post-course survey (19 questions: mixed quantitative + qualitative)  
**Timeline:** 2–6 months post-course

## Key Findings

**Behavioral Change: Strong Evidence**
- ≥75% reported significant improvement (scores 4–5/5) across 7 clinical domains:
  - ABCDE method, patient transfer, trauma surveys, shock management, altered consciousness

**Most Effective Teaching Methods:**
1. Simulations (highest impact)
2. Skills stations
3. Knowledge testing

**Implementation Barriers:**
- **Primary:** Lack of supplies/equipment
- Secondary: Limited clinical opportunities, time constraints

**Knowledge Cascade:**
- Majority intended to train colleagues
- Plans to replicate BEC in their regions
- Integrate systematic approach into facility protocols

## Methodological Strengths & Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Systematic design aligned with established Kirkpatrick model
- Mixed-methods (quantitative + qualitative)
- Multi-country implementation
- Multiple training modalities assessed

**Limitations:**
- 39% response rate (self-selection bias)
- Self-reported behavioral change (not directly observed)
- Temporal gap (2–6 months post-course, recall bias)
- No supervisor observation data for triangulation

## Implications

**Program Strengths:** Practical learning, multi-modal training, motivated knowledge cascade  
**Gaps Requiring Support:** Resource availability, supervisor engagement, trainer development, post-course follow-up

**Key Recommendation:** Behavioral change alone insufficient—systems-level support (resources, protocols, supervisor enablement) essential for sustainability.
